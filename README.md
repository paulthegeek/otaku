# What is Otaku?
A place to share your favorite geek movies, tv shows, comics, books, and video
games and learn what other geeks are into.

In your profile you will have the ability to mark your favorites from the five
categories. You will also have the ability to add a favorite if it is currently
not avaliable as a selection.

Geeks will be able to follow each other to keep up with the new things people
love. The dashboard will also provide a way for the geek community to see what
is the most popular items based on category.
